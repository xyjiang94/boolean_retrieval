        "text": "\n'0-41*' is a 91-minute account of real people, real lives and real experiences, set in a real place. Directed by Senna Hegde, this full-length Indian docudrama features dramatized re-enactments of actual events and offers an in-depth and honest look at the rural way of life in India. The film has no actors. It is filmed in a neorealist/documentary style with actual people playing characters with the same names and occupations as in real life, thus blurring the boundaries between drama and reality.  Aided by the flourishing landscapes of Kanhangad, with Arai river roaring in the background, this film is a beautiful representation of the everyday life of a group of people who spend their evenings playing Volleyball, entering a world far removed from the bustle of life. The film showcases their life, their aspirations and fears, and their point of view on the rest of the world. Volleyball becomes the crucial part of this film as it acts as the thread holding the film together.\nThe film had its world premiere at the 11th Cinema On The Bayou Film Festival at Lafayette, USA.\nA bunch of local youth in a small town in India are closely knit by a game of volleyball every evening. Rajesh and Vipin lead the two teams with a great deal of passion until a seemingly endless losing streak sets Rajesh and his team on a trail of disbelief and dejection. The docudrama proceeds to draw a subtle parallel between the losing streak and the lives of these youth. Over the course of six days, this film brings into sharp focus their life stories, their aspirations and expectations, their faith and fears and their view on the rest of the world with the rural way of life in India providing a vivid backdrop.\n* Rajesh Thoyammal\n* Predeep Hegde\n* Vipin Kavvai\n* Abhilash Thoyammal\n* Priyadath TK\n* Sanal Manu\n* Ebi Ganesh\n* Vishnu Lakshmanan\n* Sunil Thoyammal\n* Ambu\n* Official Selection at the 11th Cinema On The Bayou Film Festival, Lafayette, USA.\n* Official Selection at the 1st RapidLion, the South African International Film Festival, Johannesburg, SA\n* Official Selection at the 3rd Noida International Film Festival, New Delhi, India.\n* Official Selection at Miami Independent Film Festival, Miami, USA.\n* Official Selection at Newark international Film Festival, Newark, USA.\n* WINNER - Best Cinematography, 3rd Noida International Film Festival On 7 February 2016.

        "text": "\n'1:54' is a French Canadian film directed by Yan England. Starring Antoine Olivier Pilon, Lou-Pascal Tremblay and Sophie N\u00e9lisse, it also features roles by David Boutin, Patrice Godin, Robert Naylor and Anthony Therrien. The film launched on wider screens on 13 October 2016 tackles the phenomenon of bullying in schools.\n1:54, a social / psychological drama thriller, tells the story of Tim, a 16-year old timid yet brilliant student (played by Antoine Olivier Pilon), who has been suffering from bullying in school and seemingly non-stopping intimidation and menace for the last 5 years by some of his schoolmates and particularly at the hands of the arch-bully in his school Jeff Roy (played by Lou-Pascal Tremblay). Tim who lives with his father (played by David Boutin) after his mother's early death, cannot confide in his own father despite the latter's efforts to get to the bottom of what is ailing his son. \nTim's situation becomes even more precarious in his grade 11 year, because of his continuing friendship with classmate Francis (played by Robert Naylor), a gay youth and Tim's own sexuality issues and his increasing infatuation with Francis, although Tim is reluctant of going public about it. Tim is reluctant to go to the school authorities as he is \"no snitch\", but finds solace in the friendship of Jennifer (played by Sophie N\u00e9lisse), a schoolmate who takes Tim's case to heart.  After a dramatic outing of Francis, and Tim's erratic behavior distancing himself at least publicly from him for the fear of being exposed himself, Francis commits suicide despite Tim's pleas.\nViewers gradually learn that Tim used to be a star runner but had stopped a couple of years back when his mother died. Mr. Sullivan (played by Patrice Godin), the coach of the school running team, is pushing hard to have Tim return to racing, and eventually Tim decides to do just that \u2014 mainly because he sees it as his opportunity to get even with Jeff. His move to join \"Les Coriaces\" a sports club for the sole ambition of qualifying for the Nationals for the 800 m running event, the specialty of his tormentor and school star athlete Jeff. This is Tim's way of getting even with Jeff for all the suffering Jeff has caused. The title 1:54 is the time Tim has to make running the 800 m to qualify to the Nationals for the distance. \nMatters turns to worst as in a weak moment after a school binging party, Tim intoxicated with alcohol engages in a casual gay sex encounter with Jeff filming the whole incident on his cellular device. As Tim catches up with Jeff's coveted time of 1:54 in running, Jeff first blackmails Tim with publishing  the footage on social media in case Tim goes on with his scheme of stealing Jeff's position in qualifying. During the final run, a desperate and vindictive Jeff first intimidates Tim and then in a desperate move seeing Tim's insistence in winning the race, instructs his friend to publish the footage online. Tim confronted with his painful outing and public shaming, finds support from his father towards his son's sexuality and outing. The father also who pleads with the school board to stop Jeff and arranges for his son finishing his school year through home schooling with help from his school and teachers. But it is too late, as Tim has already prepared a make shift bomb to blast Jeff's celebration party after the latter's victory and qualification to the Nationals. He has also released a video footage on his own online page explaining why he is engaging in this final act. Tim had developed his skill of bomb-making through chemical experiments he had conducted in preparation with a joint lab project earlier with his now-deceased friend Francis. In his last moment of remorse of possibly causing great havoc and mayhem, he tries to remove the bomb he has placed, but dies himself as the bomb explodes in his hands. The last scene shows the reactions of many who knew Tim and could do nothing, with Jeff in a remorseful mood trying to justifying or self-excuse himself by saying that his actions were meant as \"just a joke\".\nThe film was featured during the 2016 Qu\u00e9bec City Film Festival with the film winning the award for \"Best Student Film\" and the film's star Antoine Olivier Pilon the award for \"Best Actor\" during the festival. It was also featured during the Busan International Film Festival in South Korea, the 9th edition of Festival du film francophone d'Angoul\u00eame in France (23-28 August 2016) and the 31st Festival International du Film Francophone de Namur in Belgium (30 September to 6 October 2016). \nThe film is England's debut long feature film, following his short film Henry, which was a finalist during the 85th Academy Awards for the category of Best Live Action Short Film.\nThe Qu\u00e9bec City Film Festival screening held in the Quebec capital's Palais Montcalm on 23 September 2016 was attended by Premier of Quebec Philippe Couillard, a number of government ministers and Quebec City mayor R\u00e9gis Labeaume.\nThe film has prompted wider discussion in Canadian schools with demands of showing the film in various schools to encourage open discussions and wider public awareness of important issues the film tackles like competitiveness in youth sports and rivalry between athletes, bullying, physical violence, verbal abuse and intimidation in schools, sexual orientation among youth and teenage homosexuality, public outing, online shaming, youth suicide, ostracism, blackmail, rejection, humiliation, desperation, vengeance, handling of grief,\n* \n* [ Trailer to 1:54 in French with English subtitles] \n",

The film was an international collaboration over nearly three years, with additional crew in Sydney, London, Mexico, and the Netherlands. The film features a cameo voice role by veteran actor and The X-Files star William B. Davis. The film's sound was designed by BAFTA-winner Martin Cantwell.\nIn the year 2204, the Earth has become a dystopian wasteland. In order to maintain strict population levels, any newborn  is only permitted to live if another person's life is traded in and a receipt issued. Edward K. Wehling, Jr. sits in Chicago Lying-In Hospital waiting for the birth of his triplets, except he has no receipts to collect them.\n* Mackenzie Gray as Dr. Hitz\n* Tyler Johnston as Edward K. Wehling, Jr.\n* Jason Diablo as the Painter\n* Melissa Roxburgh as Leora Duncan\n* Artin John as the Orderly\n* William B.

Shortly after, it was announced that actor Paul Giamatti was attached to the project as the character Dr. Hitz. Actor Mackenzie Gray took the role of Dr. Hitz after Giamatti left due to scheduling conflicts.\nThe film's visual design was prepared by artists working from Vancouver, Sydney, and the Netherlands. Filming took place over three days at the Waterfall Building in Canada. The film was edited in Vancouver, but its picture lock was undone and post-production was moved to Sydney for editing, additional visual effects and music. Sound designer Martin Cantwell joined the project, working from London.\nThe film's soundtrack makes extensive use of Schubert's Ave Maria in a version recorded especially for the film by Australian soprano and conductor Dr. Imogen Coward.\nThe film premiered at the Sci-Fi-London festival on 29 April 2016, and later in Los Angeles at the Oscar-qualifying HollyShorts Film Festival. Shortly after, the film was selected for the Oscar-qualifying LA Shorts Fest.\nAn official trailer was released on 1 November 2016.\n2BR02B: To Be or Naught to Be received positive reviews from critics, festival organizers and festival audiences. Daniel Abella, director of the New York Science Fiction Festival, called it one of the six must-see films of the festival and Outer Place critic Chris Mahon described it as \"well-executed and beautifully shot.\" WILDsound Fest's official full-length review of the film by Kierston Drier described it as \"one of those rare gems of short cinema that will set your philosophical mind in motion... There is a level of polish and richness that any lover of science fiction and literature will appreciate and admire.\" John Vaughan, director of The Golden Blasters (The National Irish Science Fiction Film Festival) described the film as \"An unconventional short film... it captures the sense of unease that would come if you glimpsed this particular future.\" Dumbbells & Dragons critic Rachel Bohlen rated the film as her third favourite from the HollyShorts Film Festival (Los Angeles), describing the film as a \"terrifying view of our future\" and that the adaptation \"adheres almost completely to the short story, and I must warn you \u2013 there\u2019s no happy ending here. It\u2019s bleak but thought-provoking.\"\nBoth the film's art direction and soundtrack have also received critical praise. CEO of WILDsound Fest, Matthew Toffolo and the festival's audience praised Leon Coward's interpretation of The Happy Garden of Life mural into a complex, story-rich work of art, concluding that \"from a cinematic point of view... they did nail it.\" In an essay/interview published in The Schubertian (Journal of the Schubert Institute UK), Anna Black described the soundtrack's use of Schubert's Ave Maria as \"a lasting and haunting shred of beauty and humanity in a future where it has otherwise been abandoned.\"\n* [ Official Trailer] on YouTube\n* [ Official Facebook]\n* [ 2BR02B: To Be or Naught to Be] at the Internet Movie Database\n* [ WILDsound Fest Audience Video] on YouTube\n",
